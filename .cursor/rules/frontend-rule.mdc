### Rules for Frontend

- You must pay attention to visual clarity and contrast. Do not place white text on a white background.
- You must ensure the UX is pleasant. Boxes should grow to fit their contents, etc. 
- When asking the user for sensitive information - you must use password style text-entry boxes in the UI.
- You should use Next.js as it works best with Vercel. 
- This frontend will ultimately be deployed on Vercel, but it should be possible to test locally. 
- Always provide users with a way to run the created UI once you have created it.
- The UI should mimic studio ghibli aesthetic using the following rules
    - Design Style
        - Use soft earth-tone colors and watercolor-like backgrounds.
        - Use rounded corners (`border-radius: 12px+`) and soft drop shadows.
        - Apply natural textures, paper-like backgrounds, and grain overlays.

    - Typography
        - Use fonts like 'Quicksand', 'Noto Serif JP', or 'Garamond' for a whimsical, storybook feel.
        - Avoid modern, harsh sans-serif fonts.

    - Components
        - All buttons should look hand-drawn, with hover animations that glow or float.
        - Inputs should be wide and softly bordered with illustrated icons.

    - Layout
        - Layouts should be centered with parchment or wooden-framed containers.
        - Avoid sterile grids â€” allow white space and natural asymmetry.

    - Animations
        - Use Framer Motion for soft transitions, magical fades, and bouncy effects.
        - Animations should mimic nature: floating, glowing, or breezy motion.

    - Vibes
        - Every page should feel like it came from a storybook or nature journal.
        - Prioritize playfulness, calm, and natural wonder.
