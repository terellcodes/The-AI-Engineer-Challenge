Task 1: Redesign UI To resemble an IDE
- Remove studio ghibli references from cursor rules
- Ask for a screenshot for inspiration
    - new UI should match the color theming instead of studio ghibli
- UI should contain
    - collapsible left side panel
        - this is where you will be able to configure settings including
            - open ai key
            - system prompt
            - model selection
            - upload pdf
    - main content panel
        - this is where the chat conversation takes place
        - at the bottom will be the chat input box but it should resemble a terminal window like in an IDE
            - include send and clear button

Task 2: Suggest followup questions for each chat response
- UI
    - below each chat assistant conversation response should be three suggested followup questions
- To fetch the followup questions:
    - modify the chat_with_pdf prompt, ask LLM to return 3 questions based on the chunks provided in the prompt
    - return these 3 questions in the response


Task 3: Data Structure + Abstract Data Type Anotation and Followup questions
- When there is a data structure, abstract data type or method or algorithm returned in the response make it hoverable
- Upon hover there should be an interactive pop up with a description of the entity as follows:
    - for data structure
        - description
        - common operations
        - common applications
    - for abstract data types (ADT):
        - types of implementations
        - common applications
    - for algorithms and methods
        - time and space complexity
        - common applications
- fetch the descriptsion from the pdf
